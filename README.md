Platter. This was a project built for the 2024 BigRed Hacks hackathon hosted at Cornell University. Project contributors are Ivan Zheng, Eric Cai, and Andrew Jiang. This website is a combo of instagram and instacart, a social media platform that connects people through their similar interest in making and trying new food from all over. It was built with HTML, CSS and JS. To view the website heres the link! https://ivannzheng.github.io/platter-app/ 

Future plans and current limitations - 
I hope to add a backend to this website instead of only having purely a front end for show, i also hope to learn new frameworks that will make this process alot easier, as just straight hardcoding it took some time when something like react.js couldve sped up the project.
